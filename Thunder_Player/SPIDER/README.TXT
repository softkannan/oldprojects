Spider Crawling... :

It is simple and useful code for creating an animation for any VB project ! 

By profession, I am a  photographer/numerologist. I am a beginner in VB. Still I am learning what I get from
everywhere{like friend,on the internet.etc}. In every learning process trial & error is must for learning. I am 
still in process to learn VB more deeply. Till today I got so many help from so many VB portals  by looking 
through its valuable source codes which every VB learner should regularly visit it. 
To me, a programmer should be imaginative where an idea about a project is concerned. First, idea come then
programming. In any VB portal, there are so many imaginative programmers have submitted their source codes
for other. You should explore it. You should learn from them. For that reason today I have submitted my first program
toy in this portal for sharing with others. If you see any error in this program or you like to develop it further or
help me in this regard ,please don't hesitate to contact me through email.

Thank you,

Have a good day !
